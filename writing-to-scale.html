<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Writing to Scale</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>This is merely to say that the personal and social consequences of any medium—that is of any extension of ourselves—result from the new scale that is introduced into our affairs by each extension of ourselves, or by any new technology. —Marshall McLuhan, Understanding Media</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All other things being equal, a massive increase in scale shifts all other things. The term scale seeks balance—as in the scales of justice or a scale that weighs an object. Computer graphics are scalable when they retain their initial clarity as digitally rendered objects expand or change significantly. In art, when a sketch or model is drawn to scale, its proportionality stays in tact when an artist paints the sketch as a mural or when a sculptor carves an immense statue from stone. Broadly speaking, the scalability of conventional systems and methods function well within relatively normal deviations in size, but with massive—exponential—increases in scale, systems and methods fail to remain proportionally effective. Common techniques for constructing a twenty-floor office building will not erect a mile-high skyscraper. Propulsion systems that once pushed a spacecraft to the moon are ineffective for transporting humans to the next closest solar system. Email, the long since standard of digital communication, now seems as impotent as postal mail in a world with over 3.2 billion internet users. When systems and methods scale linearly—what is called linear scalability—they remain proportionally effective as the objects or tasks to which they are applied grow substantially.</p>
<p>In recent history, the phrase information overload describes the vast changes in scale underway for electronic and digital media. Coined in the mid-1960s, the term was eventually popularized by Alvin Toffler’s Future Shock. Like Gregory Bateson’s Steps to an Ecology of Mind or the lesser known The Macroscope by Joel de Rosnay, their work tried to make sense of the technological advancements of the ‘50s and ‘60s and their effects on changing global consciousness of the post-World War II era. Originally published in 1970, responses to Future Shock’s mass appeal were re-printed on inside the cover of the 1971 edition: C.P. Snow writes, “Remarkable…No one ought to have the nerve to pontificate on our present worries without reading it.” An excerpt from a Newsweek review explains, “even before reading the book, one is ready to acknowledge the point of its title—that we suffer from ‘future shock.’” Even Marshall McLuhan praises the text: “FUTURE SHOCK…is ‘where it’s at.’” A year later in 1972, the Future Shock documentary based on Toffler’s book opens with a bearded Orson Welles riding an airport escalator, smoking a cigar, and speaking directly to the camera:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the course of my work, which takes me to just about every corner of the globe, I see many aspects of a phenomenon which I’m just beginning to understand. Our modern technologies have achieved a degree of sophistication beyond our wildest dreams. But this technology has exacted a pretty heavy price. We live in an age of anxiety and a time of stress, and with all our sophistication we are in fact victims of our own technological strength. We are the victims of shock—of future shock.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the next scene, Welles explains that “technology feeds on knowledge and knowledge expands at a phenomenal rate.” As the documentary transitions to video of massive mainframe computers in large rooms full of connecting-wires and rotating tape drives, Welles’ narration describes the effects of computers on information overload: “these machines…combine things to make new knowledge at such high speeds that we cannot absorb it. They affect not just the things we buy—but the things we know—the things we do.”</p>
<p>I happened upon the Future Shock documentary while working on an early draft of this chapter. With Orson Welles somber tone guiding the documentary, and an analog synthesizer providing an eerie and uncomfortable soundtrack, it displays a common anxiety about the rapid pace of technological change, the disruption of the nuclear family, the decision paralysis brought on by frequent and ubiquitous advertising, and the disturbing values of a pre-packaged, disposable, consumer society. Almost half a century later, I find that this anxiety has taken on new forms in similar contexts. The now archetypal “Why I’m quitting Facebook” posts—declaring a desire to unplug and to resist the urge to document every aspect of one’s life. Snapchat, one of the fastest growing new social networks, captures the paradox of this anxiety. Motivated by a growing awareness of the surveillance economy, while simultaneously fulfilling the desire to participate in self-documentation, the creators of Snapchat describe their network as providing a “solution” to the “emergency detagging of Facebook photos before job interviews and photoshopping blemishes out of candid photos before they hit the internet.” Because users “snaps” disappear a short time after they are viewed,<br />
For digital rhetoric and writing studies, the concept of future shock and its popularized phrase information overload are closely associated with our own institutional history. Drawing principally on Marshall McLuhan’s work with electronic media, and responding to composition’s traditional grand narrative, Rice’s The Rhetoric of Cool performs a disruptive alternative history of composition’s disciplinary origins. According to Rice, “1963’s importance to writing studies must now be understood as a technology-based moment, even if traditional readings of the date state otherwise” (21). XXXRice chose 1963 because of Stephen North’s The Making of Knowledge in Composition. establishes 1963 as the year composition studies earned its “capital C” (12). XXXSummarize Rice’s main pointsXXX.</p>
<p>Yet, omitted from Rice’s alternative history, future shock and information overload were also part of the technology-based moment of 1963. In the final chapter of Neil Postman’s Conscientious Objections, Postman proclaims that he and Charles Weingartner, during a 1963 address to the National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE), were “the first people to ever use [future shock] in a public forum” (162). In his Television and the Teaching of English, written with the support of NCTE in 1961, Postman provides a perspective of the technological revolution leading up to the early 1960s:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To select a specific year as marking the “technological revolution” is difficult; but 1839 is chosen because, in that year, Daguerre developed the first practical method of photography. In 1844, Morse perfected the telegraph. In 1876, Bell transmitted the first telephone message. A year later, Edison invented the phonograph. By 1894, the movies had also been introduced. A year after that, Marconi sent and received the first wireless message. In 1906, Fessenden transmitted the human voice by radio. In 1920, regularly scheduled radio broadcasts began. In 1923, a picture was televised between New York and Philadelphia. In that same year, Henry Luce and Briton Hadden created a totally new idea in magazines with Time. In 1927, the first “talkie” appeared; and in 1928, Disney’s first animated cartoon. In 1935, Major E.H. Armstrong developed the FM radio. In 1936 came Life magazine. In 1941 full commercial television was authorized. These are just some of the inventions that form a part of the “communications revolution” through which we are living. To these could be added, of course, the LP record, the tape recorder, the comic strip, the comic book, the tabloid newspaper, the electronic computer, the paperback book. (11)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By the time Postman publishes Conscientious Objections in 1988, his perception of the technological revolution transitions from the pedagogical pragmatism displayed in his early work to the conservative reactions of his later career. His “Future Shlock” (notice the l—changing schock to shlock) chapter finishes with an apocalyptic foretelling of the effects of mass media and information overload—describing the Russians as developing an Orwellian prison-culture of “suspicion and hate” and the Americans as engaging in Huxleyan self-distraction by conducting “public business as vaudeville act” (174). Given the geo-political climate of today, the re-emergence of a Russian/American rivalry, the vaudeville act of Twitter politics and 24-hour entertainment news, the state-sponsored surveillance of U.S. citizens revealed by Edward Snowden, and the erosion of privacy rights by “free” cloud and mobile technologies—it is difficult to merely ignore Postman’s prophecies about mass media and information overload. Of course, I am not suggesting, anachronistically, that Rice’s alternative history ought to have relevant in the decade after Cool’s publishing. Rather, as a performative anthem for all things new media, The Rhetoric of Cool captures the resounding positive attitude toward the networks, systems, and technologies emerging from Web 2.0.</p>
<p>Although no unified systems “upgrade” for the Internet occurred, the last decade has shown 2006 as a turning point for digital content creation. Email lists, intranets, chatrooms, newsgroups, basic websites, and peer-to-peer file sharing gave way to template design systems, blogging software, social networks, cloud technologies, and mobile applications. In 2005 global Internet access reached 1 billion, and many aspects of the Document Object Model, allowing for dynamic websites and interactive web applications (using scripting languages such as JavaScript), became supported by the top Internet browsers. By 2006, MySpace became the most visited website in the United States, YouTube was acquired by Google, Facebook became a public social network, Twitter was launched, Reddit opened its news posts to interactive commenting, and Wikipedia reached 1 million articles and began shifting its focus to improving the quality of its content. While the influence of Napster and peer-to-peer file sharing on Web 2.0 should not be downplayed, a decade later one phrase appears more indicative of Web 2.0 than all the others: user-generated content.</p>
<p>Even though the iPhone was a year away from its first release, and smartphone sales would not outpace standard mobile phone sales for another 7 years, in 2006 digital cameras captured approximately 150 billion images and mobile phones snapped an additional 100 billion. YouTube was already hosting nearly 100 million user-generated video streams per day, and in that year alone more than 1 billion music MP3s were shared over the Internet per day. In total for 2006, 161 exabytes (161 billion gigabytes) of digital information and content were generated—equivalent to 3 million times the information in every book ever written (Gantz 2007). Two decades earlier, in 1986, the total amount of global digital information and content in storage was 2.6 exabytes and by the end of 2006 this grew to 295 exabytes in total storage—equivalent to about 61 CD-ROM discs per person globally. Four years later, in 2010, the total amount of global digital storage amassed 1227 exabytes of data, outpacing previous estimates by 239 exabytes, and by 2020 it is estimated that global digital storage will reach 40,000 exabytes—equivalent to 5,200 gigabytes for every human on the planet (Gantz 2012).</p>
<p>Certainly, not all of the data described above are digital content, strictly speaking. As the study cited above notes, “the amount of information individuals create themselves—writing documents, taking pictures, downloading music, etc.—is far less than the amount of information being created about them in the digital universe.” Every query conducted within a search engine, every liked post on a social network, every visited website and clicked link, every digital purchase and online financial transaction, and every written document, shared image, and streamed video creates data about users. But this only describes the data collected with web 2.0 technologies. While the idea of the “semantic web” was once thought to be the driving force for web 3.0, allowing uniform standards of data interchange and open access to APIs (application programming interfaces) to usher in a new era of web development, the next generation of the web has merely been the web’s expansion to “smart” technologies and Internet-connected devices—the Internet of Things (IoT). Rather than “upgrading” the Internet—improving the ways in which information and content are shared, accessed, and distributed across the planet—web 3.0 is spreading the Internet to our toasters and our automobiles, to devices that to track our pets and monitor the productivity of employees, to wearable technologies that record our heartrates and our levels of emotional stress, to augmented reality games that use “play” to map and scan locations previously unavailable to mapping technologies, to automated home security systems and zone-aware thermostats and home lighting, and to the sensors and data logging technologies placed in every available form of manufacturing and industry. A significant portion of the predicted 40,000 exabytes of global data by year 2020 will come from IoT—including, but certainly not limited to data from/about human activity.</p>
